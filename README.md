I'm Nathan, a second-ish year undergraduate student studying Data Science here at Northeastern. 
I haven't work a ton with web development, but last semester I took Database Design, 
and for our final project we made a website with social networking features using php. 
In July, I will start my co-op at the MBTA as an assistant data scientist- I am very excited!

This repository is to hold my assignments for CS 4550: Web Development.
